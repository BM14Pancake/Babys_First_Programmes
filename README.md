# Babys_First_Programmes
A repository for all the programmes I've created whilst learning how to use Python.

#Hi!! This is a repository for displaying the progress I've made on Python since I started learning programming on 26 November 2020.

It is humorously titled "Baby's first programmes", since I'm almost entirely new to programming.
Most recently, I've learned to use nested loops and functions, and I'm really enjoying functions!

If you found this through my CV/Resume site, feel free to take a look!
If you stumbled upon this by chance, hi!

As a beginner and somewhat self-taught programmer, feedback from those who are more experienced would be greatly appreciated.
